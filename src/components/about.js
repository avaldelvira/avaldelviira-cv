          My hometown is Barcelona, but London has been my home for the last
          five years. I have been developing websites and web applications
          professionally for more than 14 years. I transitioned to develop with
          React by the end of 2017 and Iâ€™ve been working on that environment
          since then. I am passionate about building responsive, user oriented
          and accessible applications with a great focus on making the web an
          inclusive space for everybody championing accessibility through my
          career and becoming an a11y.
